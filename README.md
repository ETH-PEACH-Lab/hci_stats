# HCI Stats

This repository contains in-class exercise for the "Statistical Analysis in Practice" lecture from prof. April Wang.

The purpose of this exercise is for students to practice on their own. There is no need to submit the analysis notebook. We have updated the repository to include a reference solution.

- `starter.ipynb` is the notebook you will use for the exercise lecture
- `dataset.csv` is a fake dataset based on the example VR controller study we discussed during the lecture
- `h1_anova.ipynb` is an example ANOVA solution for H1
- `reference.ipynb` is the reference notebook to `starter.ipynb`

## Install Dependencies

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Open the Notebook
- You can open the jupyter notebook through VS Code, or the jupyter lab/notebook platform if you have it installed locally
